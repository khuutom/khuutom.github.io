				<h2>Brigham and Women's Hospital</h2>
				<h3>Mechanical Engineering Research Coop</h3>
				<p>The Traverso Lab at Brigham and Women's Hospital, MIT, and Harvard Medical School is a research
					program focused on
					developing next-generation drug delivery systems as well as biomedical devices to support
					physiological sensing for
					safe and efficient therapeutics in the gastrointestinal tract. Giovanni Traverso, M.D., Ph.D. is
					principal investigtator.
					<br>
					My role was to use computer simulation and wet lab experimental testing to develop e-GLUE, a novel,
					electrically responsive
					hydrogel. This biocompatible material becomes adhesive when introduced to an electric signal.
					Applications for this hydrogel in the
					GI tract include hemostasis bandages to promote healing, drug delivery patches for localized
					efficacy, and biosensing device
					platforms for long-term retention.
					<br>
					I used COMSOL Multiphysics to visualize the effects of electric current and fields of various
					mechanical designs and determine
					the configuration for maximum adhesion and minimum temperature increase. I then designed and
					performed experiments to verify
					these findings in-vitro and characterize the e-GLUE performance using an Instron tensile tester.
					Experimentation progressed to
					ex-vivo, then in-vivo with swine animal models. In-vivo x-ray testing saw an improvement of
					initially less than 7 day retention in the
					stomach to 30 day retention using improved electrodes and techniques. Experimentation progressed
					again to include a drug delivery
					study to collect data on drug presence in the blood over time. I produced a standard calibration
					curve for HPLC chemical analysis to
					prepare for upcoming blood samples. This data collection is ongoing and will be included in a future published article.
					<br>
					Unique skills were required for this position. I utilized COMSOL to build simulations, Solidworks
					and AutoCAD to model the electrodes,
					laser cutting to manufacture parts, wet lab equipment to synthesize hydrogels, biosafety and
					chemical hoods for handling material, and
					experimental methods from in-vitro to ex-vivo and in-vivo.
					<br>
					Above all, I met a diverse group of researchers originating from all over the world. I listened to
					many stories and got to know
					many personalities. While much of the work was independent and self-driven, I was motivated by
					brilliant people around me.
					This was my introduction to the limitless world of medical research, and I am a more curious learner because
					of it.

				<h2>Desktop Metal</h2>
				<h3>Process and Material Development Engineering Coop</h3>
				<p>
					My assignment on the Process team was to take ownership of 316L stainless steel binder-jet metal 3D printing
					development. High profile clients required smooth surface finish on parts. Porosity became a challenge since 
					the stock material form, metal powder particles, inherently have void spaces between them.
					<br>
					I designed and conducted a large scale experiment to determine which printing parameters affect the porosity,
					strength, and smoothness 
					of finished parts. I worked in the lab 3D printing over 2000 metal parts, systematically varying target parameters,
					 and gathering data throughout
					the manufacturing process. This spanned from metal powder handling to printing to sintering. My results indicated that
					layer thickness, interior binder concentration, and powder roller speed all influence porosity. I acheived as much as 99% density 
					in some parts and as low as 86% in others, indicating an appropriate experimental signal range. I presented my
					 work to the process team to communicate knowledge across all printing platforms.
					<br>
					Additionally, I managed characterization of materials for other projects using standardized strength (tensile, TRS) and powder 
					cohesion tests, mounting and polishing, scanning electron microscope and optical microscope, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy,
					and CT scanning. 
					<br>
					I extended my coop and took on another project focused on implementing a novel powder spreading technique to be implemented in a 
					future hardware product. Consistent powder height
					was desired across the entire print bed. I selected the optNCDT laser sensor to measure the powder height during overnight prints. Also,
					I designed and 3D printed a custom bracket to mount the sensor to the spread gantry. I analyzed data post-print in Python to flag
					occurrences of print defects related to powder spreading. This reduced the turnaround time for printing process development.

				<h2>Northeastern University Civil Engineering Lab</h2>
				<h3>Lab Technician</h3>
				<p>
					This work-study position allowed me to consult with Capstone groups to create parts using SolidWorks, 3D printers, and machine equipment.
					The in-house FDM printers were from Makerbot and Axiom. A group designing offshore wind turbine models requested the majority of FDM printer work
					for their bouyant components. Various groups requested parts from the mill, such as custom brackets, and the lathe, such as custom slide pins.
				</br>
					I maintained lab spaces by organizing materials prior to and after civil engineering course sessions. This included setting up Instron
					mechanical testing machines. I also diagnosed and repaired faulty lab equipment to ensure operational status. The Axiom dual extrusion 
					printer was brought back to operational status once I contacted the manufacturer and calibrated the print nozzle assembly.

					The design specifications were to carry a 5lb payload over 1000ft and collect flight data on both

					the interfaces between sections of the rocket and ensure precise fitment while enabling sucessful

					OpenRocket, and GrabCAD as the main software packages
					throughout the process. The project ended with the launch of Needle, our 7ft tall 4in diameter
					custom rocket, in May of 2021 at Amesbury MA. The launch was a success! We analyzed flight data
					afterwards and determined that large rockets designed in the
					future should be balanced with a stability ratio closer to 1 cal. Needle flew with over-stability,
