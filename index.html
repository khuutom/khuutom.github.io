				<h2>Brigham and Women's Hospital</h2>
				<h3>Mechanical Engineering Research Coop</h3>
				<p>The Traverso Lab at Brigham and Women's Hospital, MIT, and Harvard Medical School is a research
					program focused on
					developing next-generation drug delivery systems as well as biomedical devices to support
					physiological sensing for
					safe and efficient therapeutics in the gastrointestinal tract. Giovanni Traverso, M.D., Ph.D. is
					principal investigtator.
					<br>
					My role was to use computer simulation and wet lab experimental testing to develop e-GLUE, a novel,
					electrically responsive
					hydrogel. This biocompatible material becomes adhesive when introduced to an electric signal.
					Applications for this hydrogel in the
					GI tract include hemostasis bandages to promote healing, drug delivery patches for localized
					efficacy, and biosensing device
					platforms for long-term retention.
					<br>
					I used COMSOL Multiphysics to visualize the effects of electric current and fields of various
					mechanical designs and determine
					the configuration for maximum adhesion and minimum temperature increase. I then designed and
					performed experiments to verify
					these findings in-vitro and characterize the e-GLUE performance using an Instron tensile tester.
					Experimentation progressed to
					ex-vivo, then in-vivo with swine animal models. In-vivo x-ray testing saw an improvement of
					initially less than 7 day retention in the
					stomach to 30 day retention using improved electrodes and techniques. Experimentation progressed
					again to include a drug delivery
					study to collect data on drug presence in the blood over time. I produced a standard calibration
					curve for HPLC chemical analysis to
					prepare for upcoming blood samples. This data collection is ongoing and will be included in a future published article.
					<br>
					Unique skills were required for this position. I utilized COMSOL to build simulations, Solidworks
					and AutoCAD to model the electrodes,
					laser cutting to manufacture parts, wet lab equipment to synthesize hydrogels, biosafety and
					chemical hoods for handling material, and
					experimental methods from in-vitro to ex-vivo and in-vivo.
					<br>
					Above all, I met a diverse group of researchers originating from all over the world. I listened to
					many stories and got to know
					many personalities. While much of the work was independent and self-driven, I was motivated by
					brilliant people around me.
					This was my introduction to the limitless world of medical research, and I am a more curious learner because
					of it.

				<h3>Kraft Family Blood Donation Center Volunteer</h3>
				<p>I began volunteering with BWH in July 2023. Blood donation is a service I have been incorporating
					into my life,
					and I realized I could help beyond just donating myself. There are many opportunities to make
					patients feel more comfortable
					during their visit: offering snacks and drinks, providing warm blankets, setting up movies, and
					socializing. Each
					patient has their own preferences, so it is a pleasure to meet new people and provide what they
					need. Additionally, I deliver
					samples to the lab for testing, restock supplies, sanitize equipment, and set up stations for the
					next patient. Volunteering in
					the hospital systems in Boston is a fantastic way to build up the community.

				<p> I was introduced to RF communication and PCB design during my coop at BWH. Although it was not a
					part of my job responsibility, I
					took a great interest in the technology and manufacturing methods. This RC plane is a fun way to
					learn more about these techniques and
					demonstrate a range of engineering skills. My goal was to create an aerial vehicle under 2cuft with
					the longest outdoor flight time. The PCB
					design evolved from hand-drawn circuit schematics to polished files in Altium. The frame was
					designed from scratch in Solidworks and
					structurally analyzed in ANSYS. Fluid dynamics analysis for the airfoils were completed in ANSYS and
					MATLAB. Mechanical design was improved and
					iterated based on these analyses. I started in August 2023 and hope to begin manufacturing before
					October 2023.

				<h3>AeroNu Rocket</h3>

					testing, and launching a rocket.
					The design specifications were to carry a 5lb payload over 1000ft and collect flight data on both
					ascent and descent. My individual role was to engineer
					the interfaces between sections of the rocket and ensure precise fitment while enabling sucessful
					stage separation. I was also responsible for design of a
					motor section capable of transferring power from a J-class solid rocket motor. We used Solidworks,
					OpenRocket, and GrabCAD as the main software packages
					throughout the process. The project ended with the launch of Needle, our 7ft tall 4in diameter
					custom rocket, in May of 2021 at Amesbury MA. The launch was a success! We analyzed flight data
					afterwards and determined that large rockets designed in the
					future should be balanced with a stability ratio closer to 1 cal. Needle flew with over-stability,
					which introduced unwanted lateral oscillations.

				<h3>Assistive Liftware</h3>
				<p>Seven Hills Foundation provides clinical, educational, and community support for children and adults
					with disabilities or significant life challenges.
					In 2019, I partnered with a classmate to provide an engineering solution for individuals at Seven
					Hills suffering from neuro-generative disease that
					makes eating difficult. Existing products, such as LiftWare, stabilize eating utensils using
					gyroscopic sensors and motors. However, our client had
					difficulty grasping the unaccommodating handle shape. I used Solidworks to model organic surfaces of
					the LiftWare device, then I designed an attachment
					that was more comfortable for the client to hold. Additionally, the solution was easily attached and
					removed, durable, and did not permanently alter the LiftWare device.
					We used Makerbot 3D FDM printers to rapidly prototype. This was my first formal exposure to the
					engineering cycle and 3D modeling. The experience of working on the project
					and hearing positive feedback from the client inspired my university studies.
